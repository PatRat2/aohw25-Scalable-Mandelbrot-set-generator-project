I Included two .slx files for model composer

wholesystem_with_output_quadoutput.slx - Full system to be simulated
stream_mdbrt_backup5.slx - Full system to be compiled for vivado

Default parameters for both .slx files in matlab are:

bits = 48
binpoint = 32
bitsiter = 12
bitswidth = 12
bitsheight = 12



InMaxIterations = 100
InMaxIterations = [1, 100]
InStartX = [1, -2]
InStart = [1, 1]
InStartX = [1, -2]
InStopX = [1,0.47]
InStartY = [1,-1.12]
InStopY = [1,1.12]


For running the Jupyter notebook, upload it, and the .bit and .hwh file to the same directory
